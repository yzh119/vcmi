The concept step feeds the mesh step, so what matters is not a pretty picture but
a clean, evenly lit character on a plain background that image-to-3D can read.
Baked shadows, rim light and motion blur all fight the render stage later.

Writes <out>-front.png and <out>-side.png plus a .json recording the exact prompt,

Cost is reported per call; flux-2-pro is 3 credits (~$0.03) at 1MP.
