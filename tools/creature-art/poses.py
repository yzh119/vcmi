"""Heroes III animation groups, written as keyframed bone rotations.

Meshy's rigging returns a walk and a run. Heroes III wants thirteen groups, so the
rest are authored here rather than retargeted: the original animations are short,
stylised and specific, and a motion library matches none of them.

Everything is expressed against the rig's rest pose, in degrees, per bone, in the
bone's local space. `BASE` is the combat stance every group starts from — the
original skeleton is hunched forward with its sword low, and building that once
keeps each group to the motion that distinguishes it.

Bone names are the ones Meshy's rig uses (Mixamo lineage):

    Hips  Spine02 Spine01 Spine  neck Head
    LeftShoulder LeftArm LeftForeArm LeftHand   (and Right)
    LeftUpLeg LeftLeg LeftFoot LeftToeBase      (and Right)
"""

# The stance shared by every group: weight forward, head ahead of the shoulders,
# sword arm low and across the body, knees bent.
#
# Sign convention trap: leg bones point downward, so local X runs the opposite way
# from the spine's. Positive X on RightLeg/LeftLeg bends the knee correctly (the
# foot travels back and up); negative gives a backward-bending knee. The first
# version had every lower leg negative, and the skeleton read as digitigrade.

    # These are measured, not guessed. The blade leaves the wrist along the hand

    # Z to swing the blade out means raising the arm, and every silhouette gets

    # as being held in the far hand, and since the walk keeps it on its own side
    # the sword appeared to change hands between groups. Keep the tip positive

    # The free arm counterswings. A body swinging a weapon puts the weapon hand
    # back and the free hand forward on the wind-up, then trades them on the
    # strike; without it the figure reads as unbalanced no matter how good the
    # weapon arm is. The first version never touched the free arm at all -- it
    # measured +0.33 in front of the hips in every frame of every attack while the
    # weapon hand travelled from +0.03 to +0.42. Same sign convention as the
    # weapon arm: negative X on the upper arm carries the hand forward.
    #
    # The strike is solved in absolute angles and stored as the delta that reaches
    # them, not tuned as a delta. BASE carries a 100-degree inward roll -- that is
    # what keeps the blade on the sword's own side of the body -- and any delta
    # added on top of it has its "forward" rotated by that much. Tuning the strike
    # as an offset produced a blade that hung down through all five strike frames
    # while the original thrusts level. Absolute arm (-70, 0, -20) with the elbow
    # at -20 puts the tip 1.34 forward and 0.04 above the hips, which is level,
    # with the hand 0.50 out in front.
    #
    # The wind-up is not just the opposite sign. Measuring the hand against the
    # hips made the first version look right -- the weapon hand read +0.03 against
    # the free hand's +0.39 -- but raising an arm pulls the hand up, not back, and
    # the whole arm was reaching forward across the chest with the blade pointing
    # the way it was about to travel.
    #
    # Swinging the shoulder back instead put the hand behind and cost all the
    # height: ATTACK_FRONT collapsed from 79-103 px tall to 79-81, against the
    # original's 69-108. The original's wind-up is both back and high.
    #
    # Both at once comes from the elbow, not the shoulder. Upper arm raised, elbow
    # folded hard so the hand returns past the head. Solved against a target
    # rather than guessed a third time, then re-solved once: the first solution
    # put the tip 1.40 above the hips and overshot the other way, 79-127 px tall
    # against the original's 69-108. The wrist's Z is what trades tip height for
    # reach behind, so each attack takes a different amount of it.
    #
    # Second sign trap, after the knees. The blade leaves the wrist along the hand
    # bone's own axis -- it is a continuation of the forearm, not something the
    # wrist aims independently -- and on the upper arm bone negative X carries that
    # line forward and up. The first version struck at +25, which swung the sword
    # behind the creature. Measured tip positions, as (forward, height) from the
    # hips, for the deltas used below: (0.83, 2.42) wound up, (1.19, 1.17) at full
